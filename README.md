Breakout game
In this game the user must try to move his paddle to prevent the ball from touching the bottom of the screen. All the while 
bouncing the ball of the paddle try and eliminate the bricks above. Their are beach balls below that are used as a safety net 
for the user. 

I was responsible for for the files of breakout.py, play.py, model.py, and constants.py. The other files were given in order 
to help with some of the classes and setting up the GUI. I had to make all the functions, helper functions, classes, and 
communication between the three files. I set constants for seperate stages of the game and in update check if the game was at 
the stage to call specific functions or intialize objects.
